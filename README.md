# mini-ray-tracer
Ray tracing is a well-known 3D rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light rays to generate realistic images. This project is a small-scale implementation of a ray tracer, and it marks my first step into the world of 3D graphics. I really enjoyed working on it and learning how rendering works at a low level.
